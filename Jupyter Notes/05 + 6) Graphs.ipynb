    "* An edge is **incident** to the two vertices that is connects \n",
    " \n",
    "The **degree** of a vertex is the number of other vertices neighboring it. If the graph is directed, the degree can be split into the **in-degree** (number of incoming connections) and the **outer-degree** (number of outgoing conditions)\n",
    "\n",
    "* The sum of vertex degrees is equal to $2|E|$\n",
    "    * Proof: Count the number of incidences. Each edge is incident to exactl two vertices, so the total number of edge-vertex incidences is $2|E|$ (i.e. two times the number of edges)\n",
    "    * The degree can also be defined as the number of incidences corresponding to a particular vertex $v$. Therefore, the total incidences is the sum of all degrees for all vertices!\n",
