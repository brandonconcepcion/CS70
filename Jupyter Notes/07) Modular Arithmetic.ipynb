    "# **Modular Arithmetic**\n",
    "\n",
    "Modular Arithmetic is 'clock math\" - that is, when the number wraps back to $0$ if they get too big> \n",
    "* You can think about it like **remainder**: $21 (\\text{mod} 10)$ for examples can be reas as \"what if the remainder of $21$ when it is divided by $10$\"\n",
    "* In this case the answer is $1$. So  $21 (\\text{mod } 10) = 1$ \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Ideas**\n",
    "\n",
    "* If we have $k (\\text{mod } j = 0)$, we can write $k = ij$ for some arbitrary $i$\n",
    "* If we have $k (\\text{mod } j = 4)$, we can write $k = ij + 4$ for some arbitrary $i$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Greatest Common Denominator (GCD corollary): Modular Arithmetic can be used to identify an important property of the GCD, wich is that GCD($x$, $y$) = GCD ($x \\text{ mod } y, \\ y$)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Addition**\n",
    "* Given that $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$, $a+c \\equiv b+c \\pmod{m}$\n",
    "* If  $a \\equiv c \\pmod{m}$ and $b \\equiv d \\pmod{m}$, then $a + b \\equiv c + d \\pmod{m}$\n",
    "* This should be pretty intuitive. Adding a constant to both sides won't change the congreuence\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Multiplication**\n",
    "* Works pretty much how you'd expect as well \n",
    "* Formally defined, if $a \\equiv b \\pmod{m}$, then $ka = kb \\pmod{m}$\n",
    "*  If  $a \\equiv c \\pmod{m}$ and $b \\equiv d \\pmod{m}$, then $a \\cdot b \\equiv c \\cdot d \\pmod{m}$\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Division and Inverses**\n",
    "* In normal number spaces, the **multiplicative inverse** of $x$ is a $y$ such that $xy = 1$. This concept still applies to modular arithmetic \n",
    "\n",
    "* If we have $x \\text{ mod }m$, then the multiplicative inverse is defined as a number $y$ such that $xy = 1 \\text{ mod } m$\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the greatest common divisor of $x$ and $x$ is $1$, then $x$ has a multiplicative inverse modulo $m$ ($x$ is relatively prime to $y$)\n",
    "\n",
    "* In a special case, if both sides of a modular equation have the same common factor, then you can divide by the factor to simplify the equaton: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 5x = 30 (\\text{ mod } 7) \\rightarrow x = 6 (\\text{ mod } 7) \\ $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have an equation: $3x = 5 (\\text{mod} 7)$\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to find the multiplicative inverse, we have to find a number, that when multiplied by $3$, will yield $1 (\\text{mod} 7)$ \n",
    "\n",
    "* Note that multiplicative inverses can only exist when the two numbers (the mod space number, and the number youâ€™re multiplying with the inverse), have a gcf equal to 1, that is, they are coprime. \n"

    "#### **Extended Euclid's Algorithm** \n",
    "* Is a method for which one can obtain gcd($a$,$b$) such that gcd($a$,$b$)  can be expressed as a linear combinaton of $a,b$\n",
    "\n",
    "* As a formula, gcd($a$,$b$) = $ax + by$\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Write out the original $a$, $b$, you're trying search for as a linear combination of both: \n",
    "    * For example, if we're trying to find $ 17^{-1} (\\text{ mod } m) $, our first two equations would look like: \n",
    "    $$54 = 1(54) + 0(17)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$17 = 0(54) + 1(17)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Repear this until the left hand sign becomes $1$, but multiply the smaller LHS equation *so $17$ in this case by the number which allows it to go \"into\" the larger number ($54$) as many times\n",
    "    * Since $17 \\cdot 3 = 51$, but $17 \\cdot 4 = 68$, we would choose $3$ to multiply the smaller equation. Let's call this value of $3$ the variable $p$\n",

    "     $$ (-3) \\cdot 17 = (-3) \\cdot 0(54) + (-3) \\cdot 1(17)$$\n",

    "\n",
    "    $$ 54 - 51 = ([1-3] (54)) + ([0 - 3] (17)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Using this new equation, which we will call equation $3$, along with the smaller original equation, call it equation $2$, we're going to repeat this process again \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Repeat this cycle of multiplying the smaller one by it's respective $p$ and subtracting it from the larger equation to get a new equation. Continue this for the new equaton, and the original \"smaller\" equation, untl you get the LHS to be $1$ \n",
    "\n",
