    "**Euclid's Algorithm** is a recursive procedure for calculating the greatest common denominator. The normal way of using Euclid's Algorithm is not as easy to do by hand, so we make use of the more iterative apporach: Extended Euclid's Algorithm \n",

    "#### **Extended Euclid's Algorithm** \n",
    "* Is a method for which one can obtain gcd($a$,$b$) such that gcd($a$,$b$)  can be expressed as a linear combinaton of $a,b$\n",
    "\n",
    "* As a formula, gcd($a$,$b$) = $ax + by$\n",
    "\n",
    "1) Write out the original $a$, $b$, you're trying search for as a linear combination of both: \n",
    "    * For example, if we're trying to find $ 17^{-1} (\\text{ mod } 54) $, our first two equations would look like: \n",
    "    $$54 = 1(54) + 0(17)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$17 = 0(54) + 1(17)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Repear this until the left hand sign becomes $1$, but multiply the smaller LHS equation *so $17$ in this case by the number which allows it to go \"into\" the larger number ($54$) as many times\n",
    "    * Since $17 \\cdot 3 = 51$, but $17 \\cdot 4 = 68$, we would choose $3$ to multiply the smaller equation. Let's call this value of $3$ the variable $p$\n",
    "    * Then, multiply the smaller LHS equation by this $p$, and subtract it from the top: \n",
    "     $$54 = 1(54) + 0(17)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "     $$ (-3) \\cdot 17 = (-3) \\cdot 0(54) + (-3) \\cdot 1(17)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    * The result of this equation is: \n",
    "\n",
    "    $$ 54 - 51 = ([1-3] (54)) + ([0 - 3] (17)) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Using this new equation, which we will call equation $3$, along with the smaller original equation, call it equation $2$, we're going to repeat this process again \n",
    "\n",
    "3) Repeat this cycle of multiplying the smaller one by it's respective $p$ and subtracting it from the larger equation to get a new equation. Continue this for the new equaton, and the original \"smaller\" equation, untl you get the LHS to be $1$ \n",
    "\n",
    "4) Once the LHS equals $1$, the gcd($a$, $b$) should be expressed as a linear combination of the two numbers $a$, $b$ such that gcd($a$, $b$) $= ax + by$\n",
    "\n",
    "5) You can just read off the multiplicative inverse directly"
