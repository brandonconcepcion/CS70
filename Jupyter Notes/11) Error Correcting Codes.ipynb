    "# **Error Correcting Codes**\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main kinds of Errors that can occur: \n",
    "1) Erasure Errors \n",
    "2) Corruption Errors\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Erasure Errors**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Erasure errors occur during the transmission of data over unreliable channels such as the Internet, where packets of data can be lost. \n",
    "* To address this, we use a method of encoding the data which allows the reconstruction of the entire message even if some packets are lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Assumptions**:\n",
    "   - Each packet's content is considered a number modulo $q$, where $q$ is a prime number, ensuring calculations are performed in $GF(q)$, the finite field of $q$ elements.\n",
    "   - The message consists of $n$ packets, and we can tolerate the loss of up to $k$ packets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Encoding the Message**:\n",
    "   - A unique polynomial $P(x)$ of degree $n-1$ is constructed such that $P(i) = m_i$, where $m_i$ is the content of the $i$-th packet.\n",
    "   - The polynomial is evaluated at additional points to create $n+k$ packets in total. This redundancy allows for the recovery of the message despite the loss of any $k$ packets.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Decoding the Message**:\n",
    "   - Using the received packets, one can reconstruct $P(x)$ using Lagrange interpolation from any $n$ out of the $n+k$ transmitted packets.\n",
    "   - This reconstructed polynomial is then evaluated at $x = 1, 2, \\dots, n$ to retrieve the original message packets $m_1, m_2, \\dots, m_n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mathematical Basis:\n",
    "- **Polynomial Construction**: The polynomial $P(x)$ encodes the packets such that $P(i) = m_i$ for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, n$.\n",
    "- **Error Correction Capability**: The system can uniquely reconstruct the polynomial and hence the message from any $n$ received packets out of $n+k$, demonstrating the resilience against up to $k$ packet losses.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example: Erasure Errors in Error-Correcting Codes**\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice wants to send Bob a message of $n = 4$ packets over an unreliable channel that can lose packets. To guard against the loss of up to $k = 2$ packets, they use a polynomial-based encoding scheme.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Message Encoding:\n",
    "- **Message**: Alice's message consists of packets $m_1 = 1$, $m_2 = 2$, $m_3 = 5$, $m_4 = 0$.\n",
    "- **Polynomial**: A polynomial $P(x)$ of degree $n-1 = 3$ is used, given by $P(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 + 5$ over $GF(7)$ (finite field of size 7).\n",
    "- **Encoding**: Evaluate $P(x)$ at points $x = 1$ to $x = 6$ to create $n+k = 6$ packets:\n",
    "  - Encoded packets: $P(1) = 3$, $P(2) = 2$, $P(3) = 5$, $P(4) = 0$, $P(5) = 6$, $P(6) = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Packet Transmission and Loss:\n",
    "- Suppose packets 2 and 6 are lost during transmission. Bob receives packets: $P(1) = 3$, $P(3) = 5$, $P(4) = 0$, $P(5) = 6$.\n",
