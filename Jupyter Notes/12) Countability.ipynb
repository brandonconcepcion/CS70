    "### **Bijections**\n",
    "\n",
    "A bijection occurs when there is a one-to-one relationships and an onto relationship between two sets \n",
    "* One-to-one means that each element in the domain is mapped to its own *unique* element in the codomain \n",
    "    * $(\\forall x,y \\in D)(f(x) = f(y) \\implies x = y)$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Onto means that each element in the codomain is mapped to by a value in the domain \n",
    "    * $(\\forall y \\in R)(\\exists x \\in D)( y = f(x))$\n",
    "\n",
    "Combining both ideas, a bijection means that each element in the domain is mapped to its own unique in the codomain, such that all elements in the codomain are used\n",
    "\n",
    "If we want to see if two sets have the same cardinality, we must show there is a bijection between the two \n",

    "### **Countability**\n",
    "\n",
    "We say that a set $S$ is *countable* if there exists a bijection from $S$ to the natural numbers, or a subset of the natural numbers\n",
    "* In other words, $S$ and $N$ have the same cardinality \n",
    "\n",
    "This should make intuitive sense, because by definition the natural numbers are countable ($1$, $2$, and so on)\n",
    "* If we can somehow number off some elements in a group and count them that way, then those elements must be countable!\n",
    "\n",
    "A set that is either finite or countably infinite is referred to as countable. \n",
    "* By contrast, a set this is not countable is called uncountable  \n",
    "\n",
    "Proving something is countable: \n",
    "* Find a bijection from $S$ to $N$ or $N$ to $S$ \n",
    "* Find a injection, or one to one mapping from $S$ to $N$, AND a one to one mapping from $N$ to $S$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Enumerability**\n",
    "\n",
    "Enumerability refers to the property of a set to be able to list its elements in a systematic and well-defined manner such that every element of the set can be reached by following a specific procedure. \n",
    "\n",
    "* In other words, a set is enumerable if its elements can be put into a sequence, where each element appears at a specific position in the sequence\n",
    "\n",
    "Some properties to keep in mind: \n",
    "* Listing a set implies that it is countable \n",
    "\n",
    "* Every element must have a unique, finite position on the list (You can number them off)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Any infinite set that can be listed is as large as the set of natural numbers \n",
    "\n",
    "One method of enumerating is to find a **recursive** definition of the set: that is, given any one element in the set, we can define the elements that immediately follows it \n",
    "\n",
    "One example of an enumerable set is that of all binary strings, $B = \\{0, 1\\}^+ = {\\emptyset, 0, 1, 00, 01, 10, 11, 000 \\cdots }$\n",
    "* This is considered enumerable because we can say that a string with $n$ bits will be guaranteed to appear before positions 2^{n + 1}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Cantor's Diagonalization**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cantorâ€™s Diagonalization is used to show that certain sets are uncountable \n",
    "* The main idea behind this method is to construct a real number that cannot be includedd in any enumeration of the elements of a given set already\n",
    "\n",
    "1) **Assume enumerability**, where you have a enumeration of ALL the elements of the set in question \n",
    "\n",
    "2) **Construct a diagonal number**: Construct a new real number by considering the diagonal elements of the enumeration. Specifically, consider the digits in the diagonal positions of the decimal expansions of the numbers in the list \n",
    "\n",
    "3) **Modify the Diagonal Number:** Modify the diagonal number by changing each digit to a different one. For example, if the digit in the first decimal place is 1, change it to 2; if it's not 1, change it to 1. Continue this process for each digit in the diagonal.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) **The New Number is Different**: The new number constructed in this way is different from every number in the enumeration. This is because it differs from each number in at least one decimal place (the diagonal place).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is especially useful when showing that there are infinitely many numbers between 0 and 1 \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
