    "# **Computability**\n",
    "\n",
    "Computability explored a fundamental question in computer science: **Are there any problems that computers inherently cannot solve?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Halting Problem**\n",
    "\n",
    "**The problem**: Given a description of a program $P$ and its input $x$, determine whether $P$ will halt (stop running) when executed with input $x$ or if it will run indefinitely \n",
    "\n",
    "Explanation: We hypothesize the existence of a program, which we'll call HALT, that can analyze any other program and accurately predict whether it will halt or continue running forever given specific inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: The answer is definitively **no**; no such program HALT exists that can universally determine if any given program halts for all possible inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Reduction**\n",
    "\n",
    "In CS $70$, we will often use the Halting Problem to determine if a problem / program is computable \n",
    "\n",
    "**Reduction Concept**: If a new problem can be transformed in a way that solving it would also solve the Halting Problem, this implies that the new problem is also unsolvable. This transformation process is known as reduction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example of Reduction**:\n",
    "Consider a hypothetical problem where you need to determine if a program $F$ prints a specific output for any possible input. We can attempt to reduce this problem to the Halting Problem to determine its computability.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define TestHalt**: Create a function $ \\text{TestHalt}(F, x) $ that intends to use $F$ and $x$ to ascertain if $F$ halts when given $x$.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Prime Function $F'(y)$**: Inside $ \\text{TestHalt} $, define a new function $F'$ where $F'(y)$ invokes $F(y)$ and further operations if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Execution**: Call $F'$ within $ \\text{TestHalt} $. The output or behavior of $ \\text{TestHalt} $ depends on whether $F'$ halts. If $F'$ halts, then by our construction, so does $F$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Contradiction**: If we can reliably use $ \\text{TestHalt}(F, x) $ to determine the halting behavior of $F$, this implies that we have solved the Halting Problem, which is known to be unsolvable. Thus, our ability to determine if $F$ prints a specific output for any input must also be unsolvable if it requires knowing the halting behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem: Given a program $F$, and its input $x$, does $F$ print the number $42$ when executed with $x$?\n",
    " \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Define a new program G\n",
    "def G(x):\n",
    "    run F(x)\n",
    "    if F prints 42:\n",
    "        while True:    # Enter an infinite loop\n",
    "            continue\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return         # Halt immediately\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hypothetical function to determine if a program halts\n",
    "def HALT(program, input):\n",
    "    # This function would return true if the program halts on the given input,\n",
    "    # and false if it runs indefinitely.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Using HALT to determine if F prints 42\n",
    "def doesFPrint42(F, x):\n",
    "    if HALT(G, x) == True:\n",
    "        # G halts, which means F does not print 42\n",
    "        return False\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        # G does not halt, which means F prints 42\n",
    "        return True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If we could solve this problem of determining whether $F$ prints $42$ for any input $x$, we would also be solving the Halting Problem by determining whether $G(x)$ hatls \n",
    "* Since the halting problem is unsolvable, it implies our problem of determining $F$ prints $42$ must also be unsolvable"
