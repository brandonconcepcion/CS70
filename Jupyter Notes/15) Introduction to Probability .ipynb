    "A: A precise way of talking / reasoning about **uncertainty**\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples: \n",
    "1) Tossing a fair coin \n",
    "2) Rolling a fair **6-sided die**\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to the **sample space** as the set of all possible outcomes of a random experiement or process \n",
    "* Essentially represents the universe of possible outcomes that can occur \n",
