    "##### Example of Direct Proof: ##### \n",
    "Let $D_3$ be the set of $3$ digit natural numbers. Show that for all $n \\in D_3$ , if the alternating sum of digits of $n$ is divisible by $11$, then $11$ | $n$, or that \"$11$ divides $n$\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* Let's make use of an example so we can try and get a sense of what this means \n",
    "    * If $n=605$, then $n$ *is* indeed divisible by $11$. It's alternate sum is $6 - 0 + 5 = 11$, where $11$ divides $11$, and so this case works! \n",
    "* Next, we'll convert our original claim using propositional logic: \n",
    "    * $\\forall n \\in D_3, (11 \\mid$ alt sum of digits of n $) \\implies 11 \\mid n$\n",
    "* Now, let's try to prove our claim, by assuming that all $n$ are 3 digit natural numbers \n",
    "    * Let $a, b,$ and $c$ represent the three digits of $n$ such that $n = 100a + 10b + c$.\n",
    "    * If the alternating sum of digits is divisible by $11$, then $11 \\mid a - b + c$, or \"$11$ must divide ($a - b + c$)\"\n",
    "    * Using the definition of division, then $a - b + c = 11k$ for some natural number $k$. \n",
    "    * We're trying to prove that $n = 100a + 10b + c = 11m$ for another integer $m$ as well! \n",
    "    * Solving for $c$ from the first equation above, we get that $c = 11k + b - a$. Substitute this value back into the second equation to get $100a + 10b + 11k + b - a = 11m$\n",
    "    * Simplying this equation, we find that the statement above is equivalent to:  $99a + 11b + 11k = 11m$.\n",
    "    * Since $99$ and $11$ are themselves divisible by $11$, then we have shown that this claim **must** be true!"

    "    * $Q$ is \"$n$ is even,\" so the contrapositive would be \"$n$ is odd\"\n",
    "* Let's use the definition of an odd number ($n = 2k + 1$ for some natural number $k$): \n",
    "    * If $n = 2k +1$, then $n^2 = 4k^2 + 4k + 1$ = $2(2k^2 + 2k) + 1$.\n",
    "    * Since this is also the form of an odd number, $n^2$ must also be odd!\n",

    "* Next, if $p$ is a prime divisor of $q$, then it must be one of the elements in: $[p_1 \\times p_2 \\cdots \\times p_k]$. So, we can assume that $p$ divides the number $r$ = $p_1 \\times p_2 \\times \\cdots \\times p_k$. \n",
