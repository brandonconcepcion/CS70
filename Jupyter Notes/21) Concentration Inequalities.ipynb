    "### What are **Concentration Inequalities?** ###\n",
    "* They are Inequalities which tell us how far a random variable $X$ is likely to be away from its expectation $E[X]$\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why are they useful?** ###\n",
    "* Expectations are easy to compute - so if $X$ is close to $E[X]$, we have a lot of information about $X$\n",
    "* Allow us to quantify how tightly a random variable concentrates around its mean, or expected value \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How are concentration Inequalities different from Variance?** ####\n",
    "* Variance is a measure of the *spread* or *dispersion* of a random variable around its mean, providing information about how much individual observations vary from the expected value \n",
    "\n",
    "* Concentration Inequalities provide bounds on the probability a random variable deviates from its mean by a fixed amount\n",
    "    * They essentially **quantify** a probabilistic guarantee on how tightly a random variables concentrates around its mean\n",

    "Consider the scenario: \n",

    "* The expectation of $X$ is $E[X]$\n",
    "\n",
    "What can you tell me about the $P[X \\geq c]$, or what is the upper bound on the probability of $X$ being greater than $c$?\n",

    "By **Markov's Inequality**, we know that the **max** probability of observing $X \\geq c$ is:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE*** this is only for *Non-negative* random variables \n",
    "\n",
    "The intuition for this is that $E[X]$ must be **as large as** the $E[X \\geq c]$, which is just $c \\cdot P[X \\geq c]$. Swapping around values gives us Markov's Inequality\n",
