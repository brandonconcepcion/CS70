    "# Stable Matching #\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction ###\n",
    "\n",
    "The **stable matching problem** deals with how to match one group to another group while trying to maximize everyone's 'happiness'\n",
    "\n",
    "It works best when the two groups are **distinct**(nobody can be in both groups at once) and the orderings are **complete** (everyone in the other group has to show up in all orderings).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Definitions ####\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to more concretely set up the stable matching problem, let's define some terms more formally: \n",
    "\n",
    "A **pairing** is a set of job-candidate pairs that uniquely (disjointly) matches each job to each candidate\n",
    "* The pairing of  {(Esports, Joe), (Steakhouse, Donald)} is considered a valid pairing if we're trying to match Joe and Donald to two possible jobs, Esports and Steakhouse\n",
    "\n",
    "A **rogue couple** is a single pair where both individuals would prefer being with each other over their currently matched partner. If a pairing is **stable**, it cannot contain any rouge couples \n",
    "\n",
    "**x-optimal matching** is a stable pairing that favors the choices of group $x$ over the other group. This group is **whichever group proposes** - \n",
    "* So in the case above, if the candidates proposed to the jobs, then the stable pairings would be *candidate* optimal and *employer* pessimal\n",
    "\n",
    "But What does *optimal* even mean? \n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the **optimal candidate** for a job, this means that for a given job $J$, the optimal candidate for $J$ is the highest rank candidate on $J$'s preference list that $J$ could be paired with in any stable matching \n",
    "* So *given* that the matching is stable, the optimal candidate is the best candidate a job can do in a matching\n",
    "\n",
    "The same is similar for the **optimal job** for a candidate, where for a given candidate $C$, the *optimal* job for $C$ s the highest ranked job on $C$'s preference list that $C$ could be paired with in any stable matching\n",
    "* So *given* that the matching is stable, the optimal job is the best job a candidate can do in a matching\n",

    "### The Propose and Reject Algorithm ###\n",
    "\n",
    "\\usepackage{cancel}\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a good number of ways we can get stable matchings, but one of the most commonly used methods is the **propose-reject algorithm**: \n",
    "\n",
    "1) On the first day, each job sends an offer to their favorite candidate.\n",
    "2) Each candidate has their own set of preferences, though, so if they get multiple job offers they'll reject all but their favorite one \n",
    "3) The candidate will then say to their favorite offer, \"I like it, but please wait until tomorrow so I can see if I get a better offer\". \n",
    "    * We refer to this kind of event as when the candidate puts their most preferred job \"on a string\"\n",
    "4) Repeat until each job gets exactly one candidate \n",
    "\n",
    "##### Important notes about this algorithm #####\n",
    "* It is **guaranteed** to terminate \n",
    "* **Every day**, it only gets better for the candidates. This is because candidates can choose their best offer, so as more offers keep rolling in they get more (and better) choices. \n",
    "* In this case, the algorithm outputs a **job-optimal** and **candidate-pessimal** pairing. \n",

    "#### Existence (Termination) ####\n",
    "\n",
    "**We can prove this by contradiction**: \n",
    "* Suppose that a job isn't paired yet after the end of the algorithm. This would mean that a job must have made an offer to every single possible candidate and got rejected by all of them \n",
    "\n",
    "* This is illegal! Those candidates must be matched with other jobs if they rejected *this* one, meaning there needs to be $1$ more job than there actually is. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Therefore, all jobs and candidates must be paired at the end of the algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Stability ####\n",
    "\n",
    "* Let's say a job $J$ and candidate $C$ are matched after the algorithm terminates. If $J$ preferred another candidate $C^*$, then that would mean $C^*$ were higher up on its list, and *must* have made an offer to $C^*$ before $C$. \n",
    "* However, the fact that $J$ is matched with $C$ and NOT $C^*$ means that $C*$ rejected $J$, and thus prefers another job over $J$\n",
    "* This means that the pairing $J$ and $C$ is stable (you can repeat this argument for any pair $J$ and $C$)\n",

    "\n",
    "Theorem: When Jobs Propose and Candidates Reject, the Propose-Reject algorithm produces a job-optimal pairing\n",
    "\n",
    "* Proof by contradiction: \n",
    "    1) Assume the algorithm is not job/employer optimal\n",
    "    2) A job's offer is rejected by its optimal candidae on the day $k$\n",
    "* Assume that on this day $k$, job $J$ was rejected by its optimal candidate $C^*$ in favor of another job $J^*$\n",
    "* Since $C^*$ is job $J$'s optimal candidate, that implies that there exists a stable matching $T$ where $J$ and $C^*$ are paired ($J$, $C^*$), and $J^*$ and $C^\\prime$ are paired ($J^*$, $C^\\prime$)\n",
    "* Thus, in order to run into contradiction, we must show that within this pairing $T$, ($J^*$, $C^*$) is a rouge couple\n",
    "* Well, we already know that $C^*$ prefers $J^*$ over $J$, as she rejected $J$ in favor of $J^*$ on day $k$\n",
    "* We also know that $J^*$ had not been rejected by its optimal candidate before day $k$, as we initially assumed that day $k$ was the first day a job was rejected by its optimal candidate \n",
    "* Thus, this means $J^*$ prefers $C^*$ at least as much as its optimal candidate, and so it must prefer $C^*$ at least as much as $C^\\prime$, its pairing in $T$\n",
    "* Therefore, since we can show $J^*$ and $C^*$ prefer each other at least as much as their parterns in stable matching $T$, $T$ by definition is *not* stable, and so we run into a contradiction \n",

    "* We will now show that $S$ cannot be a stable matching, especially showing that ($J$, $C$) is a rogue couple \n",
