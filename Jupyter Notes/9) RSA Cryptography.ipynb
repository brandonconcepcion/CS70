    "# **RSA Cryptography**\n",
    "\n",
    "The internet is built upon the fact that information needs to go from point $A$ to point $B$ quickly, accurately, and securely\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to ensure our messages can't get intercepted is to **encrypt** then - mix them up to become incomprehensible using some secet code, then decrypt it at the other end \n",
    "\n",
    "**RSA** is an encryption scheme that takes advantages of **public keys** to solve this very problem\n",
    "* When Alice wants to send a message to Bob, she must go through a couple steps to ensure Eve is not able to retrieve the message \n",
    "\n",
    "Some key terms are as follows: \n",
    "* $N$: the product of $p$ and $q$, $ \\ \\ p \\cdot q$, which are two relatively large prime numbers \n",
    "    * We think of messages to Bob as numbers modulo $N$, excluding values $0$ and $1$\n",
    "    * Also note that $p$ and $q$ are not published to the world\n",
    "\n",
    "* $e$: The product of $p-1$ and $q - 1$, denoted as   $(p - 1) \\cdot (q - 1)$\n",
    "\n",
    "* Bob's public key is $(N,e)$, which is published to the whole world\n",
    "\n",
    "* $d$ denotes Bob's private key, which is found by taking the inverse of $e \\text{ mod } ( (p - 1) \\cdot (q - 1) ) $\n",
    "    * $(p-1)$ and $(q-1)$ must be coprime \n",
    "\n",
    "We can now defined our encryption and decryption functions: \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Encryption**: When Alice wants to send a message $x$ (assumed to be an integer mod $N$) to Bob, she computes the values $E(x) = x^e (\\text{ mod } N)$ and sends this to Bob\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Decryption**: Upon receiving the value of $y = E(x)$, Bob computes $D(y) \\equiv y^d (\\text{ mod } N)$; this will be equal to the original message $x$\n",

    "##### **RSA Encryption Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the RSA encryption scheme as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Let $p = 5$, $q = 11$, and $N = pq = 55$. (Note: In practice, $p$ and $q$ should be much larger for security reasons).\n",
    "- We choose $e = 3$, which is relatively prime to $(p - 1)(q - 1) = 40$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, Bob's public key is $(N, e) = (55, 3)$. His private key is $d = e^{-1} \\mod 40 = 27$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any message $x$ that Alice (or anybody else) wishes to send to Bob, the encryption of $x$ is $y \\equiv x^3 \\pmod{55}$. The decryption of $y$ is $x \\equiv y^{27} \\pmod{55}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "- If the message $x = 13$, then the encryption is $y = 13^3 \\equiv 52 \\pmod{55}$, and this is decrypted as $52^{27} \\equiv 13 \\pmod{55}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The Security of RSA follows upon the basic assumption that:\n",
    "* Given $N$, $e$, and $y = x^e \\pmod{N}$, there is no efficient algorithm for determining $x$\n",
    "* Not efficient to find th prime factorization of $N$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Fermat's Little Theorem**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a numbers $a$, and prime number $p$, where $a$ is any integer not divisible by $p$, then \n",
    "\n",
    "$$a^{p-1} = 1 \\pmod{p}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "or \n",
    "\n",
    "$$a^{p} = a \\pmod{p}$$\n",
